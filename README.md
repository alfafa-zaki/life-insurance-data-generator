# Life Insurance Data Generator

## Overview
The **Insurance Data Generator** is a Python-based tool designed to create synthetic life insurance datasets. This generator simulates realistic policyholder data, which can be used for machine learning, statistical modeling, or testing applications. The generated dataset includes demographic, health, and policy-related information, offering flexibility and customization for various insurance data use cases.

## Features
- Generate synthetic data for 100,000 policyholders (modifiable).
- Includes demographic details (age, gender, income, BMI).
- Simulates health-related data (smoker status, medical history).
- Calculates policy premiums, maximum claims, and policy details.
- Outputs data in tabular format for easy integration into analysis workflows.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alfafa-zaki/life-insurance-data-generator.git
   cd life-insurance-data-generator
   
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Run the generator script:
   ```bash
   python insurance_data_generator.py
   ```
   The script will generate a Pandas DataFrame containing the insurance data. You can export it as a CSV:
   ```python
   life_insurance_data.to_csv('life_insurance_data.csv', index=False)
   premium_production.to_csv('premium_production.csv', index=False)
   historical_claim.to_csv('historical_claim.csv', index=False)
   ```
